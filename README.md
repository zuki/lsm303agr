# `lsm303agr`

> A platform agnostic driver to interface with the LSM303AGR (accelerometer + compass)

## What works

- Reading the accelerometer
- Reading the compass and temperature sensor

## TODO

- [ ] Make sure this works with the `i2cdev` crate (i.e. with the Raspberry Pi)
- [ ] Configuration. e.g. selecting the accelerometer / compass sensing range / sensitivity.
- [ ] How to make the API compatible with device specific features like DMA and interrupts?
- ???

## Examples

You should find at least one example in the [f3] crate.
